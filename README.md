1. This section deals with calculating error inside superconducting circuits using Energy relaxation and Dephasing noise as well as Depolarizing noise
using the article: https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.062318.

2. The problem in which we are interested to observe the effect of noise is taken from the article (3rd one): https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys2385
